# Miniscope DAQ Software

This software interfaces with a Miniscope and additional behavioral camera to stream and record video

## Getting Started

This software has been test on PCs running Windows 10. The ".exe" requires the additional download of a couple OpenCV 3.4.3 dll's to run. See below for how to download them.

### Prerequisites

You will need to download opencv_world343.dll and opencv_world343d.dll and place them in the same folder containing "MiniScopeControl.exe". 

You can download all of OpenCV here, https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.4.3/opencv-3.4.3-vc14_vc15.exe/download.
Find the required dll's in "opencv/build/x64/vc14/bin"

Or you can try to grab only the 2 required dll's from my Google Drive here, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xZrRcIMf4dlrWX80ETP5STo9SS9PoGtW
